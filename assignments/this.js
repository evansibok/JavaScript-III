/* The for principles of "this";
* in your own words. explain the four principle for the "this" keyword below.
*
* 1. Global Binding - Whenever "this" is called in a global context it refers to the global window object.
* 2. New Binding - When "this" is called in a new constructor, "this" refers to the instance of the object called.
* 3. Implicit Binding - When a function called by a preceding ".", the object left of the dot gets the "this".
* 4. Explicit Binding - When "this" keyword is called either using "call", "apply", or "bind" this is explicit binding.
*
* write out a code example of each explanation above
